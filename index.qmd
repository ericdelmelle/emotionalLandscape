## Motivation:

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" style="padding-top: 20px;"}
- **Role of Urban Parks:**  
  - promoting *physical* activity  
  - reducing *mental* health issues  
  - offering a space for *community* engagement  

<br>

- **Public Health Impact:**  
  - green spaces reduce *stress*  
  - mitigate *urban heat*  
  - improve *air quality*

## Motivation:
- Limitations of Traditional Surveys 
  - resource-intensive, time-consuming
  - results can become quickly outdated

<br>

- Leveraging Social Media Data
  - `real-time`
  - cost-effective
  - extensive data 

<br>

- However, 
  - can we capture public sentiment on park use and perceptions (?)
  <br>
  - is social media representative (!?)


## Relevant Work 
- Social Media in Urban Studies
  - Google Reviews, Twitter, and Instagram could be valuable data sources in urban research
  - in the context of parks, it helps to understand visitor behavior and preferences
  
<br>

- sentiment and emotion analysis in urban spaces
- natural language processing [NLP] is increasingly used to interpret text data 
- derive public sentiment and emotional insights

## Research Questions

- What are the temporal, functional and spatial trends in emotional sentiments and visitation patterns at urban parks?
<br>
- What are the features frequently mentioned in reviews for different park visiting emotions?
<br>

- **Methodology**: NLP algorithm to detect emotions
- **Data**: Google Reviews scraped for all parks in Philadelphia



## Methodology

::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%" style="padding-top: 20px;"}
- **Sentiment Analysis**  
  - *Hugging Face*’s NLP transformer models were used to classify sentiment as positive or negative
<br>
- **Emotion Analysis**
  - Categorize emotions into six types **Inspiration**, **Relaxation**, **Engagement**, **Discovery**, **Frustration & Annoyance**, and **Sorrow**
<br>
- **Data Processing**
  - Emotions categorized using `K-means` clustering to identify meaningful groups

## Data

- **Source**  
  - *Google Reviews* for Philadelphia parks, covering data from 2016 to 2024
<br>
- **Data Preparation**
  - Scraping with Outscraper, data cleaning and integration with PPR to remove duplicates and ensure accuracyw
<br>
- **Review Filtering**
  - Only parks with over 25 reviews were analyzed, resulting in a sample of 92 parks and over 37,000 reviews
<br>

## Data: spatial distribution of reviews

## Data: temporal distribution (1)

## Data: temporal distribution (2)

## Data: What do these reviews look like?

## Data: example from a frequent (?) contributor

![Review from Anna K.](images/AnnaK.png){.center width=100%} 

## Data: example from a less frequent (?) contributor

![Review from Miranda Burg](images/MirandaBurg.png){.center width=50%} 


## Sentiment Analysis

- **Sentiment Scoring Approach**  
  - each review assigned a sentiment score (0-1 scale) and a sentiment label (positive / negative)
  - scores close to 0 indicating more neutral sentiment and scores near 1 indicating stronger sentiment


- **Example**
  - “Unfortunately this park is not what it used to be the area has become a known high traffic drug area but there is police getting the areas trying to do what they can but has a lot of work to go would not recommend taking your dog are children here lot of used syringes everywhere especially on the park in Grass area”  -  **negative 0.97**

## Temporal variation of sentiment scores

## Aggregated scores per park

## Emotion Analysis (1)

- **Plutchik model**  

<br>

- **Emotion Categorization Process**  
  - pretrained model from Hugging Face (“`roberta-base-go_emotions`”)
  - classify reviews into a broader range of emotions

## Emotion Analysis (3)

## Emotion breakdown per park type

## Emotion mapping: discovery and sorrow

## Emotion mapping: frustration & annoyance, inspiration

## Discussion and Limitations (1)
 
- **Representativeness**
  - reviews may not capture the full demographic spectrum 
  - overrepresentation of younger or tech-savvy individuals

<br>

- **Temporal Bias**
  - reviews are not always posted immediately after visits, potentially diluting real-time sentiment
  
<br>

- **Single Platform Limitation** 
  - using only Google Reviews could introduce bias 
  - combining with data from other platforms (e.g., Instagram) may yield a broader picture

## Discussion and Limitations (2)

- **Ethical Considerations** 
  - Data was collected with respect to privacy, without identifying individual reviewers
  
<br>

- **Contributor Weight/Reliability** 
  - reliability of sentiment may vary between platform "super contributors," who post frequently and may have a more balanced perspective, versus casual users who leave only one or two reviews
